            <p class="size-4 red"><b>If you want to report a security vulerability: DON'T WAIT!</b> Email me <a href="mailto:tryoxiss@gmail.com" class="violet">here</a>!</p> 
            <p>I cannot fix vulnerabilities with anything that is not mine, please report that to the correct people. Want to go even farther? You can fix the bug and attempt to merge it with the master branch on my community projects, but reporting is already more than enough!</p>
        </div>
        <p>Hi, I know this is blunt and a bit corprate: but I hope this can save us both time. I have tried to orginise this from most common to least common, and in a way that makes sense. </p>

        <h2 class="size-2 orange">Bugs, errors and corrections.</h2> 
        <p>If you find a bug in my code, you can raise an issue on the github page, plesae do your best to discribe the issue as well as you can, with intructions to replicate the bug. Please check for your issue already being mentioned, or if it has been marked as [wontfix]--I would like to fix everything but I have limited time. You can fix it if you want though!</p>
        <p>If you want to go above and beyond, you can even fork the project, patch the bug yourself, then create a pull request to merge it with my master copy of the project! I try and intigrate community patches to <i>most</i> of my projects--especially if they are good changes!</p>
        <p>If you found an error in a blog post or article I have written, you can email me (email at the end of this article) with the post name, link, what the rrror is, and what section and pargraph the error is in. You also may need to include what it is, and why its wrong--I don't know everything. </p>
        <p>If you find an error in a talk I have given, you may also contact me with basically the same info as above: what talk, what timestamp, what it is, and possibly why its wrong. If its a major error, I will add it to my <a href="/corrections">corrections</a> page, but unfortuntely I can't do more than that. </p>
        <p><b>Please stray away from giving minor or grammar corrections for talks, on posts I will correct them (most of the time), but I can't elsewhere for the most part.</b></p>

        <h2 class="size-2 yellow">Qustions</h2>
        <p>Hello! Before asking a question please <a href="/faq">read the FAQ</a> before submitting questions, you will get your answer faster (or at all) and you wont clutter up my inbox. If its not already asked: I may not answer it. Especially if its too specific, personal, or anything else. I do really enjoy answering hypothetical questions, I may not add them to my FAQ unless they are particaly interesting, but I might answer them!</p>
        <p>Though, some things to keep in mind with asking questions are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>I won't answer too personal/broad/unclear questions.</b> Anything that dosent feel specific enough, not sure what to say really.</li>
                <li><b>I will not answer superlatives. (best, worst, favorite, least favorite)</b>. Try spinning it a bit: "whats your favorite game" to "what is a game you have enjoyed recently" or "what game have you played the most", etc.</li>
                <li>Probably More ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <p>I almost certinly WILL credit you, but this is just to protect against someone copyright claming me on an idea I already had or was working on. Also: as soon as you send me an idea, you forfit its intellectual property to me, so that protection can work. Don't worry: unless you copy something I already made I wont do anything, I just need to cover myself.</p>
