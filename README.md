# My first website
This repository, being sick, and quite frankly a bit  of jealousy got me into web dev. I keep this repo open to show you that you can get better, and if you try you WILL get better. So if your feeling down about your skills, take a deep breath, download this source code and look at the website I made. It's bad, unresponseive, the color scheme is bad to say the least and it uses teqniques I should never have used. 

And then go to my curret website, for now its hosted at [tryoxiss.github.io](https://tryoxiss.github.io), and see how much better it is. You too can do this with time and practice. 

If your looking at getting started, and your having troubble, or anything, just keep going. If you don't enjoy it stop but think about why. You don't need to follow tutorials, learn in your own way. I just opened up a new VSCode project, installed EMMET Abbriviation, and started writing HTML. 

It took me nearly 30 minutes to link a stylesheet and get my text turning red but I did it. After that I just brought up a video of someone making a website, in fact its [this one, right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyNhxN6sToM). I followed along about 5 minutes, used what I learned to work for a an hour or so. And whenver I needed to know something, I googled it, or watched a bit in the video. It helped me pace myself. So if you are having troubble learning webdev, give that a try. 

Some final words before I go; 

- Thank you to [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell), you don't know me--and I know almost nothing about you, but without your helpful guides and videos on CSS I would have gotten frustrated and quit before I found out how much I love webdev. You start a lot of your videos with "[...] and welcome back to yet another video where I hope you fall madly, deeply, in love with CSS. And if I can't do that, I hope to make you at least a little less frustrated by it". And I can say, for all the issues I have with CSS, you suceeded. I use pure CSS most of the time. Just, if you see this, I want you to know you suceeded. 
- Thank you to [khaim](https://github.com/khaim0919), for getting into a networking course and making me jealous enough to learn webdev out of spite. /hj

And lastly, thaks to everyone who helped me along the way.
